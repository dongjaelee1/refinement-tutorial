(** ** Notations *)

(** To make Imp programs easier to read and write, we introduce some
    notations and implicit coercions.  *)

(** You do not need to understand exactly what these declarations do.

    Briefly, though:
       - The [Coercion] declaration stipulates that a function (or
         constructor) can be implicitly used by the type system to
         coerce a value of the input type to a value of the output
         type.  For instance, the coercion declaration for [AId]
         allows us to use plain strings when an [aexp] is expected;
         the string will implicitly be wrapped with [AId].
       - [Declare Custom Entry com] tells Coq to create a new "custom
         grammar" for parsing Imp expressions and programs. The first
         notation declaration after this tells Coq that anything
         between [<{] and [}>] should be parsed using the Imp
         grammar. Again, it is not necessary to understand the
         details, but it is important to recognize that we are
         defining _new_ interpretations for some familiar operators
         like [+], [-], [*], [=], [<=], etc., when they occur between
         [<{] and [}>]. *)

Coercion AId : string >-> aexp.
Coercion ANum : nat >-> aexp.

Declare Custom Entry com.
Declare Scope com_scope.

Notation "<{ e }>" := e (at level 0, e custom com at level 99) : com_scope.
Notation "( x )" := x (in custom com, x at level 99) : com_scope.
Notation "x" := x (in custom com at level 0, x constr at level 0) : com_scope.
Notation "f x .. y" := (.. (f x) .. y)
                  (in custom com at level 0, only parsing,
                  f constr at level 0, x constr at level 9,
                  y constr at level 9) : com_scope.
Notation "x + y"   := (APlus x y) (in custom com at level 50, left associativity).

Open Scope com_scope.

(** We can now write [3 + (X * 2)] instead  of [APlus 3 (AMult X 2)],
    and [true && ~(X <= 4)] instead of [BAnd true (BNot (BLe X 4))]. *)

Definition example_aexp : aexp := <{ 3 + (X * 2) }>.
Definition example_bexp : bexp := <{ true && ~(X <= 4) }>.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** Here is the formal definition of the abstract syntax of
    commands: *)

Inductive com : Type :=
  | CSkip
  | CAsgn (x : string) (a : aexp)
  | CSeq (c1 c2 : com)
  | CIf (b : bexp) (c1 c2 : com)
  | CWhile (b : bexp) (c : com).

(** As we did for expressions, we can use a few [Notation]
    declarations to make reading and writing Imp programs more
    convenient. *)

Notation "'skip'"  :=
         CSkip (in custom com at level 0) : com_scope.
Notation "x := y"  :=
         (CAsgn x y)
            (in custom com at level 0, x constr at level 0,
             y at level 85, no associativity) : com_scope.
Notation "x ; y" :=
         (CSeq x y)
           (in custom com at level 90,
            right associativity) : com_scope.
Notation "'if' x 'then' y 'else' z 'end'" :=
         (CIf x y z)
           (in custom com at level 89, x at level 99,
            y at level 99, z at level 99) : com_scope.
Notation "'while' x 'do' y 'end'" :=
         (CWhile x y)
           (in custom com at level 89, x at level 99,
            y at level 99) : com_scope.

(** For example, here is the factorial function again, written as a
    formal Coq definition.  When this command terminates, the variable
    [Y] will contain the factorial of the initial value of [X]. *)
